## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (for AI responses)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd v0-insurance-assistant
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   Create `.env.local`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=false
   ```

3. **Test OpenAI connection**
   ```bash
   node test-openai.js
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the app**
   Open `http://localhost:3000`

## How It Works

### Information Collection Flow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - User provides age and location
   - Selects "auto" insurance need
   - System uses profile for single drivers

2. **Progressive Gathering**
   ```
   Required Information (collected first):
   - Number of drivers/vehicles
   - ZIP code  
   - Vehicle year, make, model
   - Driver ages (auto-filled for single driver)
   
   Optional Information (improves quotes):
   - Years licensed
   - Marital status
   - Driving record
   - Annual mileage
   - Primary use
   ```

3. **Smart Validation**
   - Prompts validated against current question
   - 75% confidence threshold required
   - Falls back to no prompts if uncertain

4. **Quote Generation**
   - Only after all required fields collected
   - Plus 2-3 optional fields for accuracy
   - Comprehensive analysis with carrier recommendations

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Systems

**Information Tracking** (`lib/information-tracker.ts`)
- Extracts data from natural language
- Prioritizes collection order
- Prevents redundant questions
- Auto-fills from customer profile

**Quote Profile** (`lib/quote-profile.ts`)
- Builds comprehensive profile
- Calculates completeness
- Generates missing field prompts
- Tracks readiness for quotes

**Prompt Validation** (`lib/prompt-validator.ts`)
- Validates prompts match questions
- 75% confidence requirement
- Question-prompt mapping
- Fallback to no prompts

**Dynamic Prompts** (`lib/suggested-prompts.ts`)
- Context-aware generation
- Removes collected information
- Adapts to conversation state
- Post-quote action prompts

#### Key Components

- `components/chat-interface.tsx` - Main chat UI
- `components/quote-profile-display.tsx` - Progress visualization
- `components/suggested-prompts.tsx` - Dynamic prompt buttons
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - OpenAI integration & prompting

### Information Extraction Examples

```javascript
"I have a 2020 Toyota Camry" â†’ 
  year: 2020, make: toyota, model: Camry

"Just me driving" â†’ 
  numberOfDrivers: 1, age: [from profile]

"Tesla Model 3" â†’ 
  make: tesla, model: Model 3

"About 10,000 miles per year" â†’ 
  annualMileage: 10000
```

## Key Improvements

### Recent Updates

1. **Fixed prompt-question mismatches**
   - Years licensed now shows correct options
   - Vehicle year shows years, not ages
   - Model prompts adapt to selected make

2. **Enhanced collection order**
   - Drivers â†’ Vehicles â†’ Coverage
   - Required fields before optional
   - Logical progression

3. **Confidence-based prompting**
   - No prompts when uncertain
   - Validation before display
   - Better than wrong suggestions

4. **Profile age integration**
   - Single drivers use profile age
   - No redundant age questions
   - Automatic field population
