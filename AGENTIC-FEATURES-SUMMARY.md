## üöÄ Next Agentic Opportunities (Prioritized)

### 2. **Proactive Risk Assessment Agent** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)  
**Impact**: Very High

**What it does:**
- Monitors for risk factors that trigger coverage updates
- Proactively suggests adjustments before life events
- Uses location data (crime, flood, weather) for recommendations

**Example:**
```
Agent detects: ZIP code has high theft rate (FBI data)
Agent checks: Policy has no comprehensive coverage
Agent recommends: "Add comprehensive ($200 deductible)"
Reasoning: "Your area has 2x national theft rate"
Source: FBI Crime Data Explorer (2023)
```

**Required integrations:**
- FBI Crime Data API (free)
- FEMA Flood Maps (free)
- First Street Foundation (freemium) - already researched
- NOAA Storm Events (free)

**Agentic behaviors:**
- Autonomous monitoring of risk factors
- Proactive recommendations (not reactive)

- Risk scoring and prioritization

---

### 3. **Multi-Carrier Quote Orchestration Agent** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Effort**: High (1-2 weeks)  
**Impact**: Very High

**What it does:**
- Autonomously fetches quotes from 5+ carriers in parallel
- Handles different API formats, rate limits, retries
- Intelligently ranks results based on user preferences

**Example:**
```
Agent workflow:
1. Detects user's ZIP ‚Üí Filters carriers serving that area
2. Transforms profile to each carrier's API format
3. Calls 5 APIs in parallel (with retries)
4. Normalizes responses for comparison
5. Ranks by user preference (low deductible > low premium)
6. Presents top 3 with reasoning
```

**Required:**

- Builds long-term profile of priorities
- Proactively follows up on past conversations

**Example:**
```
Session 1: User asks about roadside assistance 3 times
Agent learns: User values roadside assistance
Session 2: Agent auto-includes roadside in all quotes
Session 3: "Last month you were shopping for home insurance. Ready to bundle?"
```

**Required:**
- Vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- RAG for conversation retrieval
- Embeddings for semantic search

**Agentic behaviors:**
- Preference extraction from conversation

### 5. **Claims Guidance Agent** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)  
**Impact**: High

**What it does:**
- Walks user through filing a claim step-by-step
- Gathers required information autonomously
- Validates documents (GPT-4 Vision)
- Submits to carrier API

**Example:**
```
User: "I got in an accident"
Agent:
1. Checks policy for collision coverage ‚úÖ
2. "I see you have $500 deductible. Let me help file the claim."
3. Asks for: Date, location, other party info, photos
4. Validates photos with GPT-4 Vision (clear, shows damage)
5. Submits to carrier API
6. "Claim #12345 filed. Estimated review time: 3 days"
7. Polls API for updates ‚Üí Notifies user
```

**Required:**
- Carrier claims APIs
- GPT-4 Vision for document validation
- Workflow orchestration

**Agentic behaviors:**
- Dynamic form filling (adapts to coverage type)
- Document validation (checks photo quality)
- Status tracking (polls API, notifies user)
- Multi-step workflow execution

---

### 6. **Renewal Optimization Agent** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Effort**: Low (1-2 days)  
**Impact**: Medium

**What it does:**
- Monitors policy renewal dates
- Autonomously shops for better rates 30 days before renewal
- Presents side-by-side comparison

**Example:**
```
30 days before renewal:
Agent detects: Premium increased 12% ($1,200 ‚Üí $1,344)
Agent fetches: 5 competitive quotes
Agent finds: 3 carriers offer $1,100-1,150
Agent presents: "Your premium increased 12%. Here are 3 cheaper alternatives."
```

**Required:**
- Policy renewal date tracking
- Scheduled job execution (cron)

- Detects inconsistencies or missing information

**Example:**
```
Agent analyzes: Policy, ID card, declarations page

Agent flags: "Inconsistency detected - ID card doesn't match policy"
Agent recommends: "Contact carrier to verify correct coverage"
```

**Required:**
- GPT-4 Vision for multi-document analysis
- Anomaly detection logic

**Agentic behaviors:**
- Multi-document synthesis

## üéØ Why This Matters

**Current state**: Most insurance apps just show quotes  
**Our approach**: Autonomous agents that **reason, analyze, and recommend**

**Competitive advantage:**
1. **Trust**: Evidence-based recommendations with citations
2. **Value**: Identifies gaps and savings automatically
3. **Convenience**: Proactive monitoring and optimization
4. **Intelligence**: Learns preferences, adapts to user

**Business impact:**
- üìà Higher conversions (users see gaps ‚Üí buy more coverage)
- üìà Better retention (proactive renewal optimization)
- üìà Lower support costs (autonomous claims guidance)
- üìà Differentiation (competitors don't have this)

## üî¨ What Makes It "Agentic"?

| Feature | Traditional AI | Agentic AI |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Reasoning** | Single-step | Multi-step (analyze ‚Üí identify ‚Üí recommend) |
| **Goal** | Answer questions | Optimize outcomes (compliance, protection, cost) |
| **Tools** | None | Uses NHTSA, state DB, APIs, vector search |
| **Decision-making** | Reactive | Proactive (monitors, suggests, acts) |
| **Context** | Stateless | Remembers preferences, learns, adapts |
| **Citations** | None | Cites authoritative sources |

**Example:**

**Traditional AI:**
```
User: "Is my coverage good?"
AI: "Your liability is 15/30/5. That's the California minimum."
```

**Agentic AI:**
```
User: "Is my coverage good?"
Agent:
1. Analyzes policy vs CA minimum ‚úÖ
2. Compares to industry best practices ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. Checks vehicle value using NHTSA data
4. Calculates risk based on location
5. Generates health score: 72/100
6. Recommends: "Increase liability to 100/300/100"
7. Cites: Consumer Reports (2024), CA Dept of Insurance
8. Explains: "Medical costs can exceed $15K easily. Protects your assets."
```
