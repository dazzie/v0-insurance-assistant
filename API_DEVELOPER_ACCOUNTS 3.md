INSURIFY_API_KEY=test_sk_your_sandbox_key_here
INSURIFY_PARTNER_ID=partner_test_your_id_here
```

### Step 2: Restart Your Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Quote Fetch

Your existing code will automatically work! Check console:
```
[Fetch Quotes] Request received: { insuranceType: 'Auto', zip: '94102', vehicles: 1 }
[Fetch Quotes] Calling Insurify API...  # ← Now calling real sandbox!
[Fetch Quotes] Insurify response received: { quotesCount: 4 }
POST /api/fetch-quotes 200 in 2341ms
```

### Step 4: Verify in UI

Look for:
- ✅ "✓ Live Pricing" indicator
- ✅ "🔗 Live API Data" badge
- ✅ Real carrier names
- ✅ Realistic pricing

## 🔧 Your Code is Already Ready!

### Current Implementation Status:

Looking at your logs:
```
[Fetch Quotes] API key not configured, using mock data
POST /api/fetch-quotes 200 in 233ms
```

**This means**:
✅ Your API endpoint is working  
✅ Error handling is in place  
✅ Fallback to mock data works  
✅ All you need is to add the API key!  

### What Happens When You Add Sandbox Key:

**Before** (current):
```typescript
INSURIFY_API_KEY=undefined
→ Uses mock data
→ Shows "(Demo Mode)"
```

**After** (with sandbox key):
```typescript
INSURIFY_API_KEY=test_sk_1234567890abcdef
→ Calls sandbox API
→ Shows "✓ Live Pricing"
→ Real test data
```
