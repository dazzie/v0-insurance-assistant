Start by thoroughly documenting all damages with photos, videos, and detailed written descriptions. Obtain multiple repair estimates from reputable contractors or auto body shops. Research comparable sales or replacement costs to establish fair market values. When the adjuster makes an initial offer, don't accept immediately - first offers are often low. Respond professionally: 'Thank you for your initial assessment. I've reviewed it and believe the settlement should be higher based on my research. Can we discuss the specific items where I see discrepancies?' Present your evidence systematically: 'My contractor estimates show repair costs of $X, which is $Y higher than your estimate. Here's why...' Focus on facts, not emotions. Be willing to compromise but know your bottom line. If negotiations stall, ask to speak with a supervisor or consider hiring a public adjuster for large claims. Document all conversations and keep detailed records of the negotiation process.",

Leverage points include: long customer tenure, multiple policies, clean driving record, good credit, and low claims history. Ask about new discounts: 'What discounts am I missing? Have you introduced any new programs since my last renewal?' Consider increasing deductibles or reducing coverage for rate reductions. If they won't budge on price, negotiate for coverage upgrades at the same price. Be prepared to switch if negotiations fail - loyalty without competitive rates isn't valuable.
