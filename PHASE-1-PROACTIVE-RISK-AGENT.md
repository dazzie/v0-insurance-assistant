# 🎯 Phase 1: Proactive Risk Assessment Agent - COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented **Level 4 Agentic Behavior** - Proactive risk assessment that autonomously detects risks and recommends coverage **without user input**.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Flood Risk Assessment** 🌊
- **MCP Server:** First Street Foundation API
- **Data:** Flood Factor (1-10 scale), risk level, climate projections
- **Trigger:** Automatic when policy is scanned (uses OpenCage coordinates)
- **Output:** Proactive flood insurance recommendations

### 2. **Crime Risk Assessment** 🚨
- **MCP Server:** FBI UCR Crime Data
- **Data:** Crime Index (0-100), violent/property crime rates
- **Trigger:** Automatic when policy is scanned (uses city/state)
- **Output:** Security system recommendations for high-crime areas

## 🔄 How It Works (Autonomous Flow)

```
User uploads policy
       ↓
1. GPT-4 Vision extracts text
       ↓
2. OpenCage geocodes address → lat/lon
       ↓
3. First Street assesses flood risk ← AUTONOMOUS
       ↓
4. FBI Crime checks crime index ← AUTONOMOUS
       ↓
5. Profile displays risk badges automatically
       ↓
6. Agent recommends coverage (flood insurance, security system)
```

**No user input required!** The agent proactively detects risks and makes recommendations.

## 📁 Files Changed

### Core Logic
- `lib/customer-profile.ts` - Added `riskAssessment` interface
- `app/api/analyze-coverage/route.ts` - Integrated flood & crime risk assessment
- `components/customer-profile-form.tsx` - Transfer risk data to profile

### UI Components
- `components/profile-summary-card.tsx` - Display flood & crime risk badges

### MCP Servers
- `mcp-server/fema-server/` - First Street Foundation (flood risk)
- `mcp-server/fbi-crime-server/` - FBI Crime Data (NEW)

## 🎨 UI Features

### Flood Risk Badge
- **Colors:** Green (low) → Yellow (moderate) → Red (high)
- **Data:** Risk level, flood factor, climate projections
- **Alert:** "⚠️ Flood Insurance Recommended" for high-risk areas

### Crime Risk Badge
- **Colors:** Green (low) → Yellow (moderate) → Orange (high) → Red (very high)
- **Data:** Crime index, violent/property crime rates
- **Alert:** "⚠️ Security System Recommended" for high-crime areas

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case: San Francisco Policy
1. Upload Kenneth Crann policy (1847 14th Ave, SF)
2. Watch console for autonomous risk assessment:
   ```
   [Coverage] 🌊 Proactively assessing flood risk...
   [Coverage] ✓ Flood risk assessed: Minimal (Factor: 1/10)
   [Coverage] 🚨 Proactively assessing crime risk...
   [Coverage] ✓ Crime risk assessed: High (Index: 56.8)
   [Coverage] 🎯 PROACTIVE ALERT: High crime area - security system recommended!
   ```
3. See risk badges appear in profile automatically
4. Get proactive recommendations without asking

## 🔑 API Keys (Optional)

### First Street Foundation
- **Status:** Works WITHOUT key (returns safe defaults)
- **With Key:** Real flood data + climate projections
- **Sign up:** https://firststreet.org/
- **Cost:** Free tier (1,000 lookups/month)

### FBI Crime Data
- **Status:** FREE - no key needed!
- **Coverage:** 20 major US cities + US average fallback
- **Source:** FBI UCR + City-Data.com

## 🎯 Agentic Capabilities Achieved

### ✅ Level 4: Proactive Agent
- **Autonomous Detection:** Automatically assesses risks without prompting
- **Multi-source Analysis:** Combines flood + crime data
- **Contextual Recommendations:** Suggests coverage based on detected risks
- **Evidence-based Reasoning:** Uses authoritative data sources (FBI, First Street)

### Key Behaviors
1. **Tool Use:** Calls MCP servers autonomously
2. **Goal-driven:** Optimizes for customer protection
3. **Contextual Awareness:** Understands location-based risks
4. **Proactive Recommendations:** Suggests coverage before being asked

## 📊 Impact

### For Customers
- ✅ **Automatic risk detection** - no manual research needed
- ✅ **Evidence-based recommendations** - backed by FBI/First Street data
- ✅ **Proactive protection** - coverage gaps identified instantly
- ✅ **Informed decisions** - clear risk visualization

### For Agents
- ✅ **Instant risk assessment** - no manual lookups
