## OpenAI Integration

This app now supports OpenAI for intelligent insurance coaching responses.

### Setup

1. **Get an OpenAI API key**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create an API key

2. **Configure your API key**: Update `.env.local` with your key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=false
   ```

3. **Test the connection**: Run the test script to verify OpenAI is working:
   ```bash
   node test-openai.js
   ```

### Features

- **Intelligent Responses**: Uses GPT-4 Turbo for personalized insurance coaching
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming responses for better UX
- **Fallback Mode**: Automatically uses mock responses if OpenAI is unavailable
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation context and customer profile

### Configuration Options

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required for AI responses)
- `USE_MOCK_RESPONSES`: Set to `true` to use mock responses instead of OpenAI

### Running the App

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the insurance assistant with OpenAI integration.
