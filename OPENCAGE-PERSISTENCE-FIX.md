# OpenCage Badge Persistence - Enhanced Fix üîß

## Issue Timeline

### First Bug (FIXED)
**Problem**: Badge disappeared + ZIP changed from `94122-3045` ‚Üí `94122`  
**Cause**: `extractProfileFromConversation()` was extracting 5-digit ZIPs  
**Fix**: Added `hasEnrichedAddress` check to skip ZIP extraction  

### Second Bug (THIS FIX)
**Problem**: Badge **still** disappeared after answering "Just me"  
**Cause**: `addressEnrichment` preservation logic wasn't complete  
**Fix**: Enhanced preservation with fallback + debug logging  

## Root Cause Analysis

The address protection code was:
```typescript
if (current.addressEnrichment?.enriched) {
  // Block address updates
  if (updates.address || updates.city || updates.state || updates.zipCode) {
    delete updates.address
    // ...
  }
  updates.addressEnrichment = current.addressEnrichment  // Line 204
}
```

This **looks correct**, but there's a subtle edge case:
- When you answer "Just me", `extractProfileFromConversation()` returns `{ driversCount: 1 }`
- No address fields at all
- The `if` condition on line 196 evaluates to `false`
- But `updates.addressEnrichment = current.addressEnrichment` **should still run** (line 204)

Wait... actually line 204 is **outside** the nested `if` block, so it should have worked! ü§î

The real issue might be that the spread operator wasn't preserving it properly, or there's a timing issue with React state updates.

## The Enhanced Fix

### Added Fallback Preservation (Lines 205-208)
```typescript
} else if (current.addressEnrichment && !updates.addressEnrichment) {
  // Even if not fully enriched, preserve any existing addressEnrichment data
  updates.addressEnrichment = current.addressEnrichment
}
```

This ensures that even if `current.addressEnrichment.enriched` is falsy, we still preserve the object.

### Added Debug Logging (Lines 239-245)
```typescript
console.log('[Profile Update] Address enrichment status:', {
  currentHasEnrichment: !!current.addressEnrichment,
  updatesHasEnrichment: !!updates.addressEnrichment,
  finalHasEnrichment: !!updated.addressEnrichment,
  enriched: updated.addressEnrichment?.enriched
})
```

This will show us **exactly** where the enrichment is being lost.

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Clear & Refresh
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
// Then refresh page
```

### 2. Upload Policy
- Upload the test policy document
- Wait for OpenCage verification

### 3. Verify Initial State
- ‚úì OpenCage Verified badge visible
- ‚úì ZIP shows as `94122-3045`

### 4. Answer "Just me"
- Type: `Just me`
- Press Enter

### 5. Check Console
Look for this log output:
```
[Profile Update] ‚úì Enriched address detected, applying protection...
[Profile Update] Address enrichment status: {
  currentHasEnrichment: true,
  updatesHasEnrichment: true,  ‚Üê Should be TRUE
  finalHasEnrichment: true,    ‚Üê Should be TRUE
  enriched: true                ‚Üê Should be TRUE
}
```

### 6. Verify Badge Persistence
- ‚úì OpenCage badge **MUST still be visible**
- ‚úì ZIP **MUST still be** `94122-3045`

## Expected Console Output

### ‚úÖ Good Output:
```
[Profile Update] ‚úì Enriched address detected, applying protection...
[Profile Update] Address enrichment status: {
  currentHasEnrichment: true,
  updatesHasEnrichment: true,
  finalHasEnrichment: true,
  enriched: true
}
[Profile Update] ‚úÖ Profile saved...
```

### ‚ùå Bad Output (if still broken):
```
[Profile Update] Address enrichment status: {
  currentHasEnrichment: true,
  updatesHasEnrichment: false,  ‚Üê PROBLEM!
  finalHasEnrichment: false,    ‚Üê PROBLEM!
  enriched: undefined
}
```

If you see the bad output, it means the `updates.addressEnrichment = current.addressEnrichment` line isn't executing, and we need to investigate further.

## Files Modified
- `lib/customer-profile.ts`
  - Lines 205-208: Added fallback preservation
  - Lines 239-245: Added debug logging

## Next Steps
1. Test with the instructions above
2. Share the console output
3. If badge still disappears, we'll use the debug logs to find the exact issue
