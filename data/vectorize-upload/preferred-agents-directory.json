      "content": "Independent agents represent multiple insurance companies, offering choice and competitive quotes. Pros: Shop 10-15 carriers for best rate, unbiased recommendations, one-stop shopping for all insurance needs, ability to move your business if carrier raises rates. Cons: May lack deep knowledge of specific products, varying service quality, potentially less clout with carriers. Captive agents work exclusively for one carrier (State Farm, Allstate, Farmers). Pros: Deep product knowledge, often better access to discounts, stronger relationship with underwriters, consistent service standards. Cons: Limited to one carrier's products and pricing, may push unnecessary coverage, can't shop around for you. Exclusive agents (hybrid model): Primarily one carrier but can access others for specific needs. Best choice depends on your priorities: Independence for price shoppers, captive for brand loyalty and simplicity.",
