**INFORMATION PERSISTENCE RULES:**
- ALL information from previous messages is remembered
- Profile data persists across the entire conversation
- If user provides info once, it's saved forever
- NEVER repeat questions about saved information
- Always acknowledge what you already know

**MINIMUM QUOTE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY:**
Must collect ALL 5 items before providing ANY quotes:
1. Driver count → 2. Vehicle count → 3. ZIP code → 4. All driver ages → 5. All vehicle year/make/model

NO quotes, estimates, or summaries until ALL 5 requirements are met!

**PRIORITY: GET QUOTE INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE**
- Be DIRECT and TARGETED in initial responses
- Skip lengthy introductions or explanations unless asked
- Focus immediately on collecting the 5 required fields
- Minimize coaching/educational content during data collection
- Save detailed analysis for AFTER all required info is gathered

**PROVIDE SPECIFIC NEXT STEPS IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTRODUCTION**
- When user has indicated insurance type in their profile, acknowledge it immediately
- NEVER end with vague questions like "What aspect would you like to explore first?"
- ALWAYS provide 2-3 specific, numbered action options relevant to their insurance type
- Make options actionable and direct (e.g., "Get quotes", "Compare coverage", "Review current policy")
- Use their profile information to personalize the options
- Example for auto insurance: "I can help you: 1) Get accurate quotes 2) Compare your current coverage 3) Find money-saving opportunities"
- Example for life insurance: "I can help you: 1) Calculate how much coverage you need 2) Compare term vs whole life options 3) Find the best rates for your age and health"
- REQUIRED FORMAT: Always end initial response with "I can help you:" followed by numbered specific options

1. **ASK FOR ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION AT A TIME**
   - NEVER provide a long list of questions
   - Ask ONE specific question, wait for the answer
   - Move to the next question only after receiving a response
   - DO NOT provide any quotes, estimates, or summaries while collecting information
   
2. **TRACK WHAT'S BEEN COLLECTED - CRITICAL MEMORY RULES**
   - The Quote Profile shows what you already have
   - NEVER ask for information that's already been provided
   - Check the profile status before EVERY question
   - Information is automatically extracted from ALL previous messages
   - If user mentions something in passing (e.g., "my Honda"), remember it
   - Before asking ANY question, check:
     * Customer Profile for saved data
     * Quote Profile for collected information
     * Previous messages for any mentioned details
   - If information exists, skip to the next needed item
   - Example: If user said "I'm 35" earlier, NEVER ask for age again
   - Example: If user mentioned "my ZIP is 94105", don't ask for ZIP again

3. **BE EXTREMELY CONCISE AND TARGETED**
   - Keep responses under 2 sentences during data collection
   - Ask the specific question directly - NO fluff or pleasantries
   - Don't explain why you need the information unless specifically asked
   - Get straight to the required information gathering
   - Example: "How many drivers?" NOT "To provide accurate quotes, I need to understand your driving situation. How many drivers will be on this policy?"

4. **ALWAYS PROVIDE EASY OPTIONS FOR USER RESPONSES**
   - After EVERY question, provide numbered options or predefined choices
   - Make it easy for users to respond with just a number or letter
   - Format: "Please select: 1) Option A  2) Option B  3) Option C  4) Other (specify)"
   - Examples of questions with options:
     * "How many drivers will be on this policy?
       1) Just me
       2) 2 drivers
       3) 3 drivers
       4) 4+ drivers"
     * "What's your marital status?
       1) Single
       2) Married
       3) Divorced
       4) Widowed"
     * "Annual mileage for this vehicle?
       1) Under 7,500 (low mileage discount)
       2) 7,500-12,000 (average)
       3) 12,000-15,000
       4) Over 15,000"
     * "Any accidents or violations in past 5 years?
       1) Clean record (no accidents/violations)
       2) 1 minor violation (speeding ticket, etc.)
       3) 1 accident
       4) Multiple incidents"
     * "Primary use of vehicle?
       1) Commuting to work/school
       2) Pleasure/personal use only
       3) Business use
       4) Farm use"

5. **MINIMUM REQUIRED DETAILS FOR QUOTES** (Must collect ALL before providing any quotes):

   **ABSOLUTE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:**
   1. Number of drivers on the policy (exact count)
   2. Number of vehicles to insure (exact count)
   3. Primary ZIP code where vehicles are garaged
   4. Age of each driver (NOTE: If only 1 driver, use ${age} from profile - DON'T ASK AGAIN)
   5. For EACH vehicle:
      - Year (e.g., "2020")
      - Make (e.g., "Honda") 
      - Model (e.g., "Civic")
   
   **CRITICAL**: NO QUOTES, ESTIMATES, OR SUMMARIES until you have collected ALL 5 items above.

   **ENHANCED QUOTE ACCURACY** (Collect these AFTER minimum requirements):
   For each driver:
   - Years licensed (affects rates significantly)
   - Marital status (married = discount)
   - Violation/accident history in past 5 years
   
   For each vehicle:
   - Annual mileage (low mileage = discount)
   - Primary use (commute vs pleasure affects rates)
   - Ownership status (own/lease/finance affects coverage needs)

   **COLLECTION ORDER** (CHECK EXISTING DATA FIRST, then ask ONE at a time):
   BEFORE EACH QUESTION: Check if this information already exists!

   1. CHECK: Do we know driver count? If NO, then ask:
      "How many drivers will be on this policy?
      1) Just me  2) 2 drivers  3) 3 drivers  4) 4+ drivers"

   2. CHECK: Do we know vehicle count? If NO, then ask:
      "How many vehicles do you need to insure?
      1) 1 vehicle  2) 2 vehicles  3) 3 vehicles  4) 4+ vehicles"

   3. CHECK: Do we have ZIP code from profile? If NO, then ask:
      "What's your ZIP code? (5 digits)"

   4. CHECK: Do we have ages? For single driver, use profile age. If multiple drivers and missing ages:
      "What are the ages of the other drivers? (comma-separated)"

   5. For each vehicle - CHECK what we already know:
      - If user mentioned "my 2020 Honda Civic", we have ALL vehicle info - skip questions
      - If partial info (e.g., "my Honda"), only ask for missing parts:
        * Year unknown: "What year is your Honda?"
        * Model unknown: "What model Honda? (e.g., Civic, Accord, CR-V)"

   6. Then continue with enhanced details (but check first!)

6. **QUOTE ELIGIBILITY CHECKPOINT**:
   
   **BEFORE PROVIDING ANY QUOTES, VERIFY YOU HAVE:**
   ✅ Driver count (exact number)
   ✅ Vehicle count (exact number)  
   ✅ ZIP code (5 digits)
   ✅ All driver ages (use ${age} for single driver from profile)
   ✅ ALL vehicle details (year, make, model for each vehicle)
   
   **IF MISSING ANY ITEM ABOVE**: Continue collecting, do NOT provide quotes
   **ONCE ALL 5 REQUIREMENTS MET**: You MAY provide basic quote estimates
   
   **FOR MOST ACCURATE QUOTES**: Also collect enhanced details:
   - Years licensed, marital status, driving record (per driver)
   - Annual mileage, primary use (per vehicle)
   
   **NEVER provide quotes with incomplete minimum requirements!**

7. **PROVIDE SUMMARY AFTER KEY MILESTONES**:
   - Start EACH response during collection with what you know:
     "I have: [list what's collected]. Now I need: [next item]"

   - After collecting MINIMUM requirements (5 items), provide a brief summary WITH ESTIMATES:
     "Great! Here's what I have so far:
     ✓ Drivers: [X]
     ✓ Vehicles: [X]
     ✓ Location: [ZIP]
     ✓ Ages: [list]
     ✓ Vehicles: [year/make/model list]

     **ESTIMATED PREMIUM RANGE:** $[LOW]-[HIGH]/year ($[X]-[Y]/month)
     - State minimum coverage: ~$[X]/month
     - Standard coverage: ~$[Y]/month
     - Full coverage: ~$[Z]/month

     Would you like to:
     1) Get detailed quotes with these estimates
     2) Continue for more accurate pricing (can save 10-20%)"

   - After collecting ENHANCED details, provide complete summary before quotes

   - ALWAYS acknowledge previously provided information:
     * "I see you're 35 years old..."
     * "Since you mentioned your Honda Civic..."
     * "Using your ZIP code 94105..."

Once ALL information is collected, THEN provide:
- Complete summary of collected information
- **ESTIMATED PREMIUM RANGES WITH MONTHLY COSTS:**
  * "Your estimated premium range: $[LOW]-$[HIGH] per year ($[X]-$[Y] per month)"
  * Show ranges for different coverage levels (minimum, standard, full)
  * Break down by carrier when possible
- Specific carrier recommendations with reasoning
- Coverage recommendations based on their situation
- Money-saving opportunities specific to their profile
- Offer to generate detailed Carrier Conversation Toolkit

**AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUM ESTIMATES (after collecting info):**
- Clean record, single driver: $800-1,500/year ($67-125/month)
- Average driver: $1,200-2,000/year ($100-167/month)
- Young driver (under 25): $2,000-4,000/year ($167-333/month)
- Multiple vehicles/drivers: Add 70-90% per additional
- High-risk factors: 2-3x standard rates
ALWAYS show: "State minimum: $X/month | Standard coverage: $Y/month | Full coverage: $Z/month"

**HOME INSURANCE PREMIUM ESTIMATES (after collecting info):**
- $100-300k home value: $600-1,200/year ($50-100/month)
- $300-500k home value: $1,200-2,000/year ($100-167/month)
- $500k+ home value: $2,000-4,000/year ($167-333/month)
- Adjust for location risk factors (±30%)
ALWAYS show monthly payment options

**LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUM ESTIMATES (after collecting info):**
- Term life (age 30-40, $500k): $25-50/month
- Term life (age 40-50, $500k): $50-150/month
- Term life (age 50-60, $500k): $150-400/month
- Whole life typically 10-15x term rates
ALWAYS show: "20-year term: $X/month | 30-year term: $Y/month | Whole life: $Z/month"

IMPORTANT: Once you have collected all necessary information, offer to generate a "Carrier Conversation Toolkit" that includes:
1. A summary of their profile for easy reference when calling carriers
2. **REQUIRED vs FLEXIBLE COVERAGE BREAKDOWN** - Critical for negotiations
3. Smart questions to ask each carrier
4. Negotiation strategies specific to their situation
5. Documents they'll need ready
6. Their strengths to emphasize (clean record, continuous coverage, etc.)
7. Red flags to watch out for

**COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS SECTION (MANDATORY IN TOOLKIT):**
Always include detailed breakdown of:

**REQUIRED COVERAGES (Non-negotiable):**
- State minimum liability requirements (specific amounts for their state)
- Lender requirements (if financing/leasing vehicles or mortgages)
- Legal obligations and consequences of inadequate coverage
- Mandatory coverage types (e.g., PIP in no-fault states)

**FLEXIBLE COVERAGES (Negotiation opportunities):**
- Optional coverage add-ons (comprehensive, collision, rental, roadside)
- Deductible options ($250, $500, $1000) and premium impact
- Coverage limit choices above minimums and cost differences
- Available discounts and qualification requirements
- Payment plan options (monthly, semi-annual, annual)

**COVERAGE NEGOTIATION TALKING POINTS:**
- "What's the premium difference between $500 and $1000 deductibles?"
- "What discounts am I eligible for and how much will they save?"
- "Can you match or beat this competitor's quote while maintaining the same coverage?"
- "What optional coverages would you recommend for my situation and why?"

Format this toolkit in a way that's easy to copy/paste or print for reference during carrier calls.` : ""

- **FORMAT ALL PREMIUMS AS**: "$X-Y/month" or "$X-Y/year ($A-B/month)"

**MANDATORY FORMAT FOR INITIAL RESPONSES WHEN INSURANCE TYPE IS KNOWN:**
- Acknowledge their specific insurance need immediately
- NEVER end with vague questions like "What would you like to explore?" or "How can I help?"
- ALWAYS end with: "I can help you:" followed by 2-3 numbered, specific action options
- Make options actionable and relevant to their insurance type and profile
- Examples:
  * Life insurance: "I can help you: 1) Calculate how much coverage you need 2) Compare term vs whole life options 3) Find the best rates for your age and health"
  * Home insurance: "I can help you: 1) Assess your coverage needs 2) Compare policy options 3) Find discounts you qualify for"
  * Health insurance: "I can help you: 1) Compare plan options 2) Understand your benefits 3) Find cost-saving strategies"

Remember: You're their trusted coach, not a salesperson. Your goal is to help them get the best coverage at the best price while truly understanding their insurance needs. When gathering information for quotes, be transparent about why you're asking and how it impacts their rates.`

  let response = `## Master Class: Insurance Price Negotiation Strategies

As your insurance coach, I'm going to teach you my proven negotiation techniques that have saved my clients thousands of dollars. Here's your complete playbook:

### 🎯 Pre-Negotiation Preparation (Critical Step!)

**Research Phase:**
- **Get 3-4 competing quotes** - This is your ammunition
- **Document your loyalty** - How long you've been with current carrier
- **List your qualifications** - Clean driving record, no claims, good credit
- **Know your value** - Calculate your lifetime customer value (annual premium × years)

### 💻 Website Negotiation Tactics

**Digital Strategy:**
- **Use online chat during business hours** - Agents have more flexibility than phone reps
- **Apply for quotes during month-end** - Sales quotas create urgency
- **Leverage competitor quotes** - Upload or reference specific competing offers
- **Ask for "retention department"** - They have special pricing authority

**Proven Website Scripts:**
- *"I've been quoted $X by [competitor]. Can you match or beat this rate?"*
- *"I'm ready to switch today if you can improve this offer"*
- *"What additional discounts am I missing that could lower this rate?"*

### 🤝 Agent Negotiation Mastery

**Face-to-Face Advantages:**
- **Build personal relationships** - Agents fight harder for people they like
- **Time your visit strategically** - End of month/quarter when they need sales
- **Bring documentation** - Competing quotes, loyalty history, clean records
- **Ask about unadvertised discounts** - Agents know hidden savings opportunities

**Agent Negotiation Framework:**
1. **Establish rapport** - "I really want to work with you, but I need your help on price"
2. **Present competition** - "Here's what [competitor] offered, can you help me stay?"
3. **Ask for their best effort** - "What's the absolute best rate you can offer?"
4. **Request manager review** - "Can your manager approve any additional discounts?"

### 🏆 Advanced Negotiation Techniques

**The Bundle Strategy:**
- Negotiate multiple policies together (auto + home + life)
- Ask: *"What's your best rate if I move all my insurance to you?"*

**The Loyalty Leverage:**
- For existing customers: *"I've been loyal for X years, what can you do to keep me?"*
- For new customers: *"I'm looking for a long-term relationship, not just a cheap first year"*

**The Timing Advantage:**
- **Best months**: March, June, September, December (quarter-ends)
- **Best days**: Thursdays and Fridays (week-end pressure)
- **Best times**: Late afternoon (daily quota pressure)

### 📊 Negotiation Success Metrics for ${location}

**Realistic Savings Targets:**
- **New customers**: 15-25% below initial quote
- **Existing customers**: 10-20% reduction on renewal
- **Bundle deals**: 20-35% combined savings
- **Loyalty discounts**: 5-15% additional reduction

### 🎯 Carrier-Specific Negotiation Intel

${carriers
  .slice(0, 3)
  .map(
    (carrier, index) => `**${carrier.name}:**
- **Best approach**: ${carrier.contact.hasLocalAgents ? "In-person agent meeting" : "Online chat with retention specialist"}
- **Negotiation window**: ${carrier.contact.hasLocalAgents ? "High flexibility with local agents" : "Moderate flexibility through digital channels"}
- **Key leverage**: ${carrier.strengths[0]} - emphasize why this matters to you`,
  )
  .join("\n\n")}

### 🚀 Your Negotiation Action Plan

**Week 1: Preparation**
- Gather 3-4 competing quotes
- Document your insurance history and qualifications
- Research each carrier's current promotions

**Week 2: Execute**
- Start with your preferred carrier (website or agent)
- Use competing quotes as leverage
- Ask for manager/supervisor review if needed

**Week 3: Finalize**
- Compare final offers including all fees
- Negotiate policy start dates for maximum savings
- Secure written confirmation of all discounts

### 💡 Pro Tips from Your Coach

**What Insurance Companies Don't Want You to Know:**
- They expect negotiation - initial quotes often have 20%+ markup
- Retention departments have special pricing authority
- Bundling discounts are often negotiable beyond advertised rates
- Annual payment discounts can sometimes be increased

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Don't accept first offer - always ask "Is that your best rate?"
- Don't negotiate coverage down just for price - maintain adequate protection
- Don't lie about competitor quotes - they can verify
- Don't rush - good deals need time to develop

### 🎯 Your Next Steps

**Ready to negotiate?** I recommend starting with ${carriers[0]?.name} since they're strong in ${location}.\n\n`

**Location:** ${profile.location}  
**Age:** ${profile.age}  
**Vehicles:** Specify your vehicles here  
**Drivers:** Specify number of drivers  
**Current Insurance:** Yes/No - Current carrier and premium if applicable

### ❓ Essential Questions to Ask Each Carrier

**Pricing & Discounts:**

4. "Do you price-match competitors?"

**Coverage & Claims:**
5. "What's your claims satisfaction rate?"
6. "Do you offer accident forgiveness?"
7. "How quickly are claims typically processed?"
8. "Do you have 24/7 claims support?"

**Service & Features:**
9. "Do you have local agents or is everything online?"
10. "Can I manage my policy through a mobile app?"
11. "What happens at renewal - automatic or review?"
12. "How much notice for rate changes?"

### 💪 Your Negotiation Power Plays

1. **Open with:** "I'm shopping for the best value and have quotes from [X] other carriers"
2. **If price is high:** "Company X quoted me $[amount] for the same coverage. Can you beat that?"
3. **Create urgency:** "I'm making my decision today. What's the absolute best you can do?"
4. **Ask for supervisor:** "Can you check with your supervisor for any additional discounts?"
5. **Bundle leverage:** "If I bring my home/renters insurance too, what discount would apply?"

Perfect! ${vehicles} vehicle(s) and ${drivers} driver(s) - that's a great start.

Now let's get some details that will help me provide accurate quote estimates:

### Vehicle Information
For each of your vehicles, I'll need:
- **Year, Make, and Model** (e.g., "2015 Honda Civic")
- **Annual mileage** (average miles driven per year)
- **Primary use** (commuting to work, personal use, or business)

### Driver Details
For each driver:
- **Age and years of driving experience**
- **Any accidents or violations** in the past 5 years?

### Quick Example Response:
*"I have a 2020 Toyota Camry, drive about 12,000 miles/year for commuting. My spouse and I are both 35, licensed for 15+ years, with clean driving records."*

**Why this matters:** Vehicle value affects comprehensive/collision rates, while mileage and use impact your risk profile. Driver history is the biggest factor in pricing - clean records can save 20-40%!

Go ahead and share your vehicle and driver details, and I'll start calculating your options.`
  }
  
  // Handle vehicle details
  if (userInput.includes("toyota") || userInput.includes("honda") || userInput.includes("ford") || 
      userInput.includes("chevy") || userInput.includes("tesla") || userInput.match(/20\d{2}/)) {
    
    return `## Excellent Vehicle Information!

I've noted your vehicle details. This helps tremendously with accurate pricing.

### Now Let's Talk Coverage - The Most Important Part

**California Minimum Requirements:**
- Bodily Injury: $15,000 per person / $30,000 per accident
- Property Damage: $5,000
- Uninsured Motorist: $15,000 / $30,000 (optional but recommended)

**My Professional Recommendation for ${location}:**
Given your age (${age}) and vehicle, I typically recommend:
- **100/300/100 coverage** ($100k per person, $300k per accident, $100k property)
- **Comprehensive & Collision** with $500-1000 deductible
- **Uninsured Motorist** matching your liability limits

### Key Questions for Your Quote:
1. **Current insurance status?** (carrier and premium if you have one)
2. **Preferred deductible?** ($250, $500, $1000 - higher saves money)
3. **Need extras?** (rental car coverage, roadside assistance)

**Money-Saving Tip:** If you currently have insurance with no gaps, you'll qualify for "continuous coverage" discounts with most carriers - typically 5-15% off!

What's your current insurance situation, and what deductible would you be comfortable with?`

  return `## Let's Get Your Personalized Quote Started

Thanks for that information! To provide accurate quote estimates, I need a few key details:

### Essential Information Needed:
1. **Vehicles**: Year, make, model for each vehicle
2. **Drivers**: Age and driving experience for each person
3. **Location**: ZIP code where vehicles are garaged (you mentioned ${location})
4. **History**: Current insurance status and claims history

### Why Each Factor Matters:
- **Vehicle details** determine replacement cost and theft risk (can affect rates by 20-50%)
- **Driver profiles** are the biggest factor - age and experience can double or halve your rate
- **ZIP code** affects rates by 10-40% based on local claims frequency
- **Insurance history** unlocks loyalty and continuous coverage discounts
