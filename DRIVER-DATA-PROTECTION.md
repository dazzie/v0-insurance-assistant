# 🛡️ Driver Data Protection - Smart Merge Implementation

## ✅ Feature Complete

Added **smart merge logic for drivers** to match the vehicle protection behavior.

---

## 📋 Editable Driver Fields

When driver information already exists in the profile, these fields can be updated:

### ✏️ Editable Fields:
- **`age`** - Driver's age (e.g., 35)
- **`dateOfBirth`** - Driver's date of birth
- **`yearsLicensed`** - Years with driver's license
- **`violations`** - Traffic violations (boolean)
- **`accidents`** - Accident history (boolean)

### 🔒 Protected Fields:
- **`name`** - Driver's full name (preserved from policy upload)

---

## 💻 Implementation

### Location: `lib/customer-profile.ts` (lines 167-192)

```typescript
// Smart merge for drivers - preserve existing driver data, allow age/DOB updates
if (current.drivers && current.drivers.length > 0) {
  if (updates.drivers && updates.drivers.length > 0) {
    // Merge driver updates
    updates.drivers = updates.drivers.map((updatedDriver, index) => {
      const currentDriver = current.drivers?.[index]
      
      if (currentDriver) {
        return {
          ...currentDriver, // Keep existing driver data
          age: updatedDriver.age ?? currentDriver.age, // ✏️ Editable
          dateOfBirth: updatedDriver.dateOfBirth ?? currentDriver.dateOfBirth, // ✏️ Editable
          yearsLicensed: updatedDriver.yearsLicensed ?? currentDriver.yearsLicensed, // ✏️ Editable
          violations: updatedDriver.violations ?? currentDriver.violations, // ✏️ Editable
          accidents: updatedDriver.accidents ?? currentDriver.accidents, // ✏️ Editable
        }
      }
      
      // New driver, use as-is
      return updatedDriver
    })
  } else {
    // Don't overwrite existing drivers with empty/undefined drivers
    delete updates.drivers
  }
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Scenario 1: Update Driver Age
```javascript
// Current profile
current.drivers = [{
  name: 'Kenneth Crann',
  age: undefined,
  yearsLicensed: null
}]

// User provides age
updates.drivers = [{
  age: 35
}]

// Result: Smart merge preserves name, adds age
result.drivers = [{
  name: 'Kenneth Crann',  // 🔒 Preserved
  age: 35,                // ✏️ Updated
  yearsLicensed: null     // 🔒 Preserved
}]
```

### Scenario 2: Update Date of Birth
```javascript
// Current profile
current.drivers = [{
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 35,
  dateOfBirth: undefined
}]

// User provides DOB
updates.drivers = [{
  dateOfBirth: '1989-01-15'
}]

// Result: Smart merge preserves existing, adds DOB
result.drivers = [{
  name: 'John Doe',          // 🔒 Preserved
  age: 35,                   // 🔒 Preserved
  dateOfBirth: '1989-01-15'  // ✏️ Updated
}]
```

### Scenario 3: Empty Driver Update (Vehicle Question)
```javascript
// Current profile
current.drivers = [{
  name: 'Kenneth Crann',
  age: 35
}]

// User answers vehicle question
updates = {
  vehicles: [{ primaryUse: 'Business' }]
  // drivers: undefined
}

// Result: Delete empty drivers from updates
delete updates.drivers

result.drivers = [{
  name: 'Kenneth Crann',  // ✅ PRESERVED
  age: 35                 // ✅ PRESERVED
}]
```

## 🎯 Parallel Structure

Now both **vehicles** and **drivers** have consistent protection:

### Vehicle Protection:
```typescript
if (currentVehicle?.enriched) {
  return {
    ...currentVehicle,        // 🔒 All enriched data locked
    primaryUse: ...,          // ✏️ Editable
    annualMileage: ...,       // ✏️ Editable
  }
}
```

### Driver Protection:
```typescript
if (currentDriver) {
  return {
    ...currentDriver,         // 🔒 Existing data locked
    age: ...,                 // ✏️ Editable
    dateOfBirth: ...,         // ✏️ Editable
    yearsLicensed: ...,       // ✏️ Editable
    violations: ...,          // ✏️ Editable
    accidents: ...,           // ✏️ Editable
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Complete Protection Layers

### For Vehicles:
1. 🔒 Chat API smart merge
2. 🚫 Extraction guard (skips if enriched)
3. 🛡️ Field-level protection (preserves enriched fields)
4. ✨ Empty vehicle filter (deletes empty updates)

### For Drivers:
1. 🔒 Chat API smart merge
2. 🛡️ Field-level protection (preserves existing data)
3. ✨ Empty driver filter (deletes empty updates)
4. ✏️ Selective updates (only specified fields change)

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Update Annual Mileage Only
```
User: "I drive 15,000 miles per year"
AI: Extracts annualMileage: 15000
Updates: { vehicles: [{ annualMileage: 15000 }] }
Result: 
  ✅ annualMileage updated to 15000
  ✅ All other vehicle fields preserved (year, make, model, bodyClass, etc.)
```

### Test 2: Update Driver Age Only
```
User: "The driver is 35 years old"
AI: Extracts age: 35
Updates: { drivers: [{ age: 35 }] }
Result: 
  ✅ age updated to 35
  ✅ Driver name preserved
  ✅ All vehicle data untouched
```

### Test 3: Update Both Vehicle and Driver
```
User: "The car is used for business and the driver is 40"
AI: Extracts primaryUse: "business", age: 40
Updates: { 
  vehicles: [{ primaryUse: "business" }],
  drivers: [{ age: 40 }]
}
Result: 
  ✅ primaryUse updated to "business"
  ✅ age updated to 40
  ✅ All enriched vehicle fields preserved
  ✅ Driver name preserved
```
