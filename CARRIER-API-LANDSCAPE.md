## üìà Market Reality Check

### Why So Few Public APIs?

1. **Regulatory Complexity** - 50 state regulations
2. **Competitive Advantage** - Carriers protect pricing models
3. **Channel Conflict** - Don't want to bypass agents
4. **Risk Management** - Control who sells their products
5. **Legacy Systems** - Many carriers use 30+ year old systems
6. **Licensing Requirements** - Must be licensed to sell insurance

### The Numbers:

- **Top 10 carriers** = 70% of market
- **Top 25 carriers** = 85% of market
- **Top 100 carriers** = 95% of market
- **Remaining 5,900** = 5% of market

**APIs Available:**
- **True public APIs**: < 5
- **Partner/agent APIs**: ~50-100
- **Through aggregators**: 200+ carriers
- **Total directly accessible**: ~10-20 (with proper licensing)
