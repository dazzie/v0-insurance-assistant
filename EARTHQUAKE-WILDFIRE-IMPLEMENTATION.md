## 🎯 Proactive Agent Behavior

### Autonomous Risk Detection Flow

```
User uploads policy
       ↓
1. GPT-4 Vision extracts text
       ↓
2. OpenCage geocodes address → lat/lon
       ↓
3. First Street assesses flood risk ← AUTONOMOUS
       ↓
4. FBI Crime checks crime index ← AUTONOMOUS
       ↓
5. USGS assesses earthquake risk ← AUTONOMOUS (NEW)
       ↓
6. USGS assesses wildfire risk ← AUTONOMOUS (NEW)
       ↓
7. Profile displays 6 risk badges automatically
       ↓
8. Agent makes proactive recommendations
```

**Zero user input required!**

### Proactive Recommendations

**Earthquake:**
- High/Very High Risk → "⚠️ Earthquake Insurance Recommended"
- Explains: Separate policy required, standard homeowners excludes earthquake damage

**Wildfire:**
- High/Very High Risk → "⚠️ Extended Coverage Recommended"
- Explains: Extended replacement cost, defensible space requirements

## 📊 Example: San Francisco Policy

### Risk Assessment Results

| Risk Factor | Score | Level | Alert |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 🌊 Flood | 1/10 | Minimal | None |
| 🚨 Crime | 56.8/100 | High | Security System Recommended |
| 🏚️ Earthquake | 9/10 | Very High | **Earthquake Insurance Recommended** |
| 🔥 Wildfire | 7/10 | High | **Extended Coverage Recommended** |

### Console Output

```
[Coverage] 🌊 Proactively assessing flood risk...
[Coverage] ✓ Flood risk assessed: Minimal (Factor: 1/10)

[Coverage] 🚨 Proactively assessing crime risk...
[Coverage] ✓ Crime risk assessed: High (Index: 56.8)
[Coverage] 🎯 PROACTIVE ALERT: High crime area - security system recommended!

[Coverage] 🏚️ Proactively assessing earthquake risk...
[Coverage] ✓ Earthquake risk assessed: Very High (Score: 9/10)
[Coverage] 🎯 PROACTIVE ALERT: High seismic risk - earthquake insurance recommended!

[Coverage] 🔥 Proactively assessing wildfire risk...
[Coverage] ✓ Wildfire risk assessed: High (Score: 7/10)
[Coverage] 🎯 PROACTIVE ALERT: High wildfire risk - extended replacement cost recommended!
```

### UI Display

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

### Issue: Lienholder Address Incorrectly Used

**Problem:**
- GPT-4 was extracting lienholder address (3500 Deer Creek Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304)
- Using it as customer's address instead of insured's address (1847 14th Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94122-3045)
- This caused ALL risk assessments to be wrong (Palo Alto instead of SF)

**Fix:**
Updated extraction prompt in `analyze-coverage/route.ts`:

1. **Customer Information:** Now explicitly says "INSURED'S MAILING ADDRESS (NOT lienholder address)"
2. **Garaging Address:** Now says "use INSURED'S address if not explicitly stated as different - DO NOT use lienholder address"
3. **New Field:** Added explicit "LIENHOLDER" extraction field to separate it
4. **Important Note:** Added clear instruction that lienholder address should NOT be used as customer address

**Impact:**
- ✅ Correct address geocoding
- ✅ Correct flood risk (SF coordinates)
- ✅ Correct crime risk (SF city)
- ✅ Correct earthquake risk (SF seismic zone)
- ✅ Correct wildfire risk (SF WUI zone)
