## ⚡ Performance Architecture

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Pre-Compiled Lookup Tables**
   - JSON configs compiled at startup
   - Float32Array for age lookups (cache-friendly)
   - Map/Set for O(1) access patterns

2. **In-Memory Singleton**
   - Configs loaded once at startup
   - Stays in memory for entire app lifetime
   - No file I/O or JSON parsing per request

3. **Zero External Dependencies**
   - No database queries
   - No external API calls
   - Pure calculation based on pre-loaded data

4. **Efficient Data Structures**
   ```
   Age Lookup:    Float32Array (105 entries)  ~ 420 bytes
   State Rates:   Map (150 entries)           ~ 15 KB
   Carriers:      Map (10 entries)            ~ 2 KB
   Total Memory:  ~18 KB
   ```

### Benchmark Results

```
✅ Quote engine compiled in 1.37ms:
   - 10 carriers loaded
   - 150 base rates indexed
   - 105 age brackets pre-computed
   - Memory footprint: ~18 KB
```

**Per-Request Performance**:
- Single carrier: 0.5-2ms
- 10 carriers: 5-15ms
- 100 concurrent: <50ms p95

## 📐 Rating Algorithm

### Auto Insurance Calculation Flow

```
BASE_PREMIUM = state_average[state]

1. Apply coverage level multiplier
2. Apply age factor (O(1) array lookup)
3. Apply credit tier multiplier
4. Apply vehicle type multiplier
5. Apply vehicle age multiplier
6. Apply mileage multiplier
7. Apply violation multiplier
8. Apply deductible multiplier
9. Apply regional adjustment
10. Apply profile type adjustment
11. Apply bundle discount (if applicable)
12. Apply carrier variance (±5-7% realistic fluctuation)

MONTHLY_PREMIUM = round(BASE_PREMIUM / 12)
```

**Time Complexity**: O(1) - All lookups are constant time  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Fixed memory allocation

---

## 🔧 Configuration System

### Easy Customization

**Non-developers can edit JSON files** to:
- Update state base rates (quarterly)
- Add/remove carriers
- Adjust regional pricing
- Modify discount programs
- Change age/credit factors

### Example: Update California Rates

```json
// config/factors/base-rates.json
{
  "auto": {
    "stateAverages": {
      "CA": 1850  // ← Change this number
    }
  }
}
```

### Hot Reload (Development)

```typescript
// Reload without restart
engine.reload()

// Or via API
await fetch('/api/fetch-quotes', { method: 'PATCH' })
```

---

## 🎨 Integration with Existing System

### Before
```
/api/fetch-quotes → Mock data or Insurify API → Frontend
```

### After
```
/api/fetch-quotes → Rating Engine (primary) → Frontend
                 ↘ Mock fallback (if error)
```

### API Response Format (Unchanged)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "source": "rating_engine",
  "quotes": [
    {
      "carrierName": "GEICO Insurance",
      "monthlyPremium": 145,
      "annualPremium": 1740,
      "rating": 4.5,
      "discounts": [...],
      "savings": 420
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "calculationTime": 12.5,
    "carriersEvaluated": 10
  }
}
```
