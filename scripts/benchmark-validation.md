```

### Step 2: Adjust Regional Factors
California-specific adjustments:
- High cost of living: ×1.15
- Uninsured motorist rate: ×1.08
- Litigation environment: ×1.12

### Step 3: Validate Multiplier Stacking
Current calculation reduces too much:
- Base: $1,850
- After all multipliers: $1,080 (58% of base)

Target:
- Base: $2,450
- After multipliers: $1,675 (68% of base)
