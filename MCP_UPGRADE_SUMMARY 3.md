## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test NHTSA (No Setup Required)

```bash
cd mcp-server/nhtsa-server
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"decode_vin","arguments":{"vin":"1HGBH41JXMN109186"}}}' | node index.js
```

### Setup OpenCage

1. Sign up: https://opencagedata.com/users/sign_up
2. Get API key
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   OPENCAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

### Setup First Street

1. Sign up: https://firststreet.org/
2. Get API key (1,000 lookups/month free)
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   FIRST_STREET_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

**Note:** First Street works WITHOUT API key (safe defaults), but gives MUCH better data with it!

## 🏆 First Street Upgrade Highlights

Your flood risk server was upgraded from FEMA to First Street Foundation:

**Why Better:**
- ✅ More accurate (property-level vs zone-level)
- ✅ Climate projections (30-year forecasts)
- ✅ Easier to understand (1-10 scale vs complex zones)
- ✅ Better API stability (no 404 errors)
- ✅ Graceful fallback (works without API key)

**What You Get:**
```json
{
  "floodFactor": 1,              // 1-10 scale (easy!)
  "riskLevel": "Minimal",
  "climateChange30Year": "Low",  // Future risk!
  "floodInsuranceRequired": false
}
```

vs FEMA's confusing:
```json
{
  "floodZone": "X",  // What does this mean?
  "riskLevel": "Minimal"
}
```

  // 1. Decode VIN (auto insurance)
  if (profile.vehicles?.[0]?.vin) {
    const vehicleData = await callMCP('nhtsa', 'decode_vin', {
      vin: profile.vehicles[0].vin
    });
    // Update vehicle details
  }
  
  // 2. Geocode address (all insurance)
  if (profile.address) {
    const geoData = await callMCP('opencage', 'geocode_address', {
      address: `${profile.address}, ${profile.city}, ${profile.state}`
    });
    // Update coordinates
  }
  
  // 3. Check flood risk (home insurance)
  if (profile.insuranceType === 'home' && geoData.latitude) {
    const floodData = await callMCP('firststreet', 'check_flood_zone', {
      latitude: geoData.latitude,
      longitude: geoData.longitude
    });
    // Update flood requirements
  }
  
  return enrichedProfile;
}
