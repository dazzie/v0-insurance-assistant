## 📝 Implementation

### Location: `components/chat-interface.tsx` (lines 320-383)

### Enhanced Coverage Display:

```typescript
const handleCoverageAnalysisComplete = (coverage: any) => {
  // ... profile updates ...

  // Format coverages for detailed display
  let coverageDisplay = ''
  if (coverage.coverages && coverage.coverages.length > 0) {
    coverageDisplay = coverage.coverages.map((c: any, idx: number) => {
      let line = `${idx + 1}. **${c.type}**`
      if (c.limit) line += `\n   • Limit: ${c.limit}`
      if (c.deductible) line += `\n   • Deductible: ${c.deductible}`
      if (c.premium) line += `\n   • Premium: ${c.premium}`
      return line
    }).join('\n\n')
  }

  const analysisMessage: Message = {
    content: `✅ **Policy Analysis Complete!**

I've analyzed your current policy with **${coverage.carrier}**.

**Your Current Coverages:**

${coverageDisplay}

💰 **Total Premium:** ${coverage.totalPremium} (${coverage.paymentFrequency})

⚠️ **Coverage Gaps I've Identified:**

### Example Output:

```markdown
✅ **Policy Analysis Complete!**

I've analyzed your current auto insurance policy with **Progressive Insurance**.

**Your Current Coverages:**

   • Limit: $100,000/$300,000
   • Deductible: N/A
   • Premium: $450/year

2. **Property Damage Liability**
   • Limit: $50,000
   • Deductible: N/A
   • Premium: $300/year

3. **Collision**
   • Limit: Actual Cash Value
   • Deductible: $500
   • Premium: $600/year

4. **Comprehensive**
   • Limit: Actual Cash Value
   • Deductible: $250
   • Premium: $350/year

5. **Uninsured Motorist**

   • Deductible: N/A
   • Premium: $200/year

💰 **Total Premium:** $1,675.00 (annual)

⚠️ **Coverage Gaps I've Identified:**
• Uninsured motorist coverage is below recommended levels for San Francisco
• No rental reimbursement coverage
• Roadside assistance not included

💡 **My Recommendations:**
• Consider increasing uninsured motorist to match bodily injury limits
• Add rental reimbursement for peace of mind
• Consider roadside assistance for added convenience
