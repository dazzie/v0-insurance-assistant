# Enhanced DOI Pricing System

## Overview

The Enhanced DOI Pricing System addresses the gap between official state DOI base rates and realistic insurance premiums by calculating all additional charges that are typically added to insurance policies beyond the base premium.

## The Problem

**DOI Data Limitation**: State insurance department data typically shows only base premiums, but real insurance policies include numerous additional charges:

- Policy fees and administrative charges
- State and local taxes
- Coverage add-ons and endorsements
- Risk-based surcharges
- Payment method fees

## The Solution

### 1. **Enhanced Pricing Engine** (`lib/doi-enhanced-pricing.ts`)

Calculates realistic insurance costs by adding:

#### **Policy Fees & Administrative Charges**
- Base policy fee: $35
- Endorsement fees: $15
- High-risk driver fee: $100 (if applicable)
- Late payment fees: $15-25
- Reinstatement fees: $25-50

#### **State & Local Taxes**
- State insurance tax: 1-4% of premium
- Local municipality taxes (varies)
- Fire department tax: $5-15 (some states)
- Catastrophe fund assessment: 1-3% (hurricane/flood areas)

#### **Coverage Add-Ons & Endorsements**
- **Rental Reimbursement**: $15-50/month
- **Roadside Assistance**: $8-15/month
- **Gap Insurance**: $12-35/month
- **New Car Replacement**: $20-40/month
- **Accident Forgiveness**: $30-60/month
- **Vanishing Deductible**: $25-50/month

#### **Risk-Based Surcharges**
- High-risk driver: 25-100% of base premium
- New driver fee: $50-200
- Luxury vehicle surcharge: 10-30%
- High-performance vehicle: 15-40%
- Urban area surcharge: 10-25%

#### **Payment Method Charges**
- Credit card processing: 2-3% of payment
- Installment fees: $3-8 per payment
- Electronic payment fees: $2-5 per transaction

### 2. **Available Discounts**

The system also calculates available discounts:

- **Annual Payment Discount**: 5% of base premium
- **Safe Driver Discount**: 10% of base premium
- **Good Student Discount**: 5% of base premium (under 25)
- **Anti-Theft Device Discount**: 3% of base premium
- **Multi-Policy Discount**: Varies by carrier
