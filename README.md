## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (for AI responses)
- Vectorize.io account (for RAG features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd v0-insurance-assistant
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   Create `.env.local`:
   ```env
   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=false

   # Vectorize.io Configuration (for RAG)
   VECTORIZE_IO_API_KEY=your-vectorize-token
   VECTORIZE_IO_ORG_ID=your-org-id
   VECTORIZE_IO_PIPELINE_ID=your-pipeline-id
   TOKEN=your-vectorize-token  # Alternative env var name

   # RAG System
   ENABLE_RAG=true
   ```

3. **Test OpenAI connection**
   ```bash
   node test-openai.js
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *Note: If port 3000 is in use, Next.js will automatically use port 3001*

5. **Access the app**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:3001` if port 3000 is busy)

## How It Works

### Information Collection Flow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - User provides age and location
   - Selects insurance type (auto, home, life)
   - System uses saved profile data automatically

2. **Step-by-Step Collection with Options**
   ```
   Example Auto Insurance Flow:

   Q: "How many drivers will be on this policy?"
   1) Just me
   2) 2 drivers
   3) 3 drivers
   4) 4+ drivers

   Q: "What's your marital status?"
   1) Single
   2) Married
   3) Divorced
   4) Widowed

   Q: "Annual mileage for this vehicle?"
   1) Under 7,500 (low mileage discount)
   2) 7,500-12,000 (average)
   3) 12,000-15,000
   4) Over 15,000
   ```

3. **Smart Memory & Validation**
   - Never asks for information already provided
   - Remembers details mentioned in passing
   - Acknowledges what's already known
   - Shows progress: "I have: X, Y, Z. Now I need: A"

4. **Instant Premium Estimates**
   ```
   After basic info collected:

   ESTIMATED PREMIUM RANGE: $1,200-1,800/year ($100-150/month)
   - State minimum coverage: ~$75/month
   - Standard coverage: ~$125/month
   - Full coverage: ~$175/month

   Top carriers for your profile:
   - GEICO: $95-120/month
   - State Farm: $105-130/month
   - Progressive: $100-125/month
   ```
